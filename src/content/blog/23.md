## Minimalist packing checklist â€” 3-day trip

Travel light with a single carry-on. Use this compact checklist for a 3-day trip; scale quantities for longer stays.

- Documents: passport/ID, boarding pass, credit card, insurance card, digital copies stored in cloud.
- Clothing (pack versatile pieces): 2 tops, 1 lightweight jacket, 2 bottoms, 3 pairs of underwear, 2 socks, 1 pair of shoes.
- Toiletries (travel sizes): toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, sunscreen, minimal skincare, any medications (in original packaging).
- Electronics: phone + charger, universal adapter, earbuds, power bank.
- Misc: reusable water bottle, small first-aid kit, compact tote or foldable bag, zip locks for wet/dirty items.
- Security & organization: one packing cube for clothes, one small pouch for cables and toiletries.

Packing tips

- Roll clothes to save space and reduce wrinkles.
- Wear your bulkiest shoes and jacket on the plane to free up luggage room.
- Limit shoes to one extra pair; they take most space.
- Put heavy items near the wheels/base of the bag for better balance.

Final reminder

If in doubt, remove the least versatile item. Travel light, move easier, and enjoy the trip.
