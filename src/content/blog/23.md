## Minimalist packing checklist — 3-day trip

Travel light with a single carry-on. This checklist is optimized for convenience, versatility, and quick packing.

Quick checklist (copyable)

- [ ] Passport / ID
- [ ] Boarding pass / tickets (digital backup)
- [ ] Credit card / cash
- [ ] Travel insurance card / meds
- [ ] 2 tops (neutral colors)
- [ ] 2 bottoms (one can double as day/night)
- [ ] 1 lightweight jacket
- [ ] 3 underwear, 2 socks
- [ ] 1 pair comfortable shoes (wear on plane)
- [ ] Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, sunscreen (travel sizes)
- [ ] Phone + charger, power bank, earbuds
- [ ] Universal adapter (if needed)
- [ ] Reusable water bottle (empty through security)
- [ ] Small first-aid kit, zip bags for laundry
- [ ] Packing cube + small pouch for cables/toiletries

Actionable packing rules

1. Choose neutral, mix-and-match clothing so each top pairs with both bottoms.
2. Pack fabrics that dry fast and resist wrinkles (merino, synthetics).
3. Use one medium packing cube for clothing and one small pouch for electronics/meds.
4. Put liquids into a single clear zip bag for security checks.
5. Wear bulky items (jacket, sneakers) on travel days to free carry-on space.

Smart tweaks

- Replace one top with a smart-casual option if you may attend a meeting or dinner.
- Keep an outfit laid out for day 1 to avoid morning packing stress.
- If traveling with reusable items (bottle, tote), compress them when not in use.

Printable tip

Fold this checklist to a single page and keep it in your phone notes for fast packing before trips.

Final reminder

If something feels non-essential at the last minute, leave it — less is more when you're on the move.
